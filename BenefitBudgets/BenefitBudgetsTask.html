                <p class="intro_text">If you want to save, you need a clear idea of what's coming in and where your cash is going out.
                    Before we start thinking about
                    paying off debt, a week away in the sun or your dream house, all of us first need to know where our
                    money is going before we can
                    put any of it aside.</p>

                    You might be worried about how much you owe or how much you are spending, but this is the first big

                    you how you feel about and if you
                    are worried about money, and will direct you to the support that is available to you right now.</p>

                    month before you start to put money
                    aside for the future. Savings are very important to make sure you're looked after in future. But
                    taking care of yourself today is
                    essential too. It's also important to make sure that your budget gives you enough money to pay off
                    any money you owe.</p>

                    need to
                    take a look at where you’re making unnecessary purchases that you could substitute for a more
                    maintainable option – or cut back on altogether. Could you swap your daily Starbucks for a reusable
